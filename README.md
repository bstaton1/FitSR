# FitSR

This is an R package written to facilitate fitting the state-space spawner-recruit models presented in the author's dissertation and subsequent manuscript. For this reason, it was written in a highly specific manner, and other users will likely not be interested in using it for other applications. It can, however, provide an example for users interested in conducting these sorts of analyses. `FitSR` was designed to receive input from the `SimSR` [package](<https://github.com/bstaton1/SimSR/>). The most current version may be installed using: 

```R
devtools::install_github("bstaton1/FitSR")
```

Specific versions can be installed using:

```R
devtools::install_github("bstaton1/FitSR@v0.1.3")
```

Version 0.1.3 was used for the dissertation chapter and subsequent manuscript.
